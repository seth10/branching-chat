---NEW USER---
User types in a passphrase and hits Enter. On the client side it checks that the length of the passphrase is at least 8 characters.
The passphrase is hashed and a call to branching-chat_login is made.
The Lambda function looks up the hash in the branching.chat_users table. It is not found, so it knows this is a new user.
braching-chat_login then looks up the hash in branching.chat_banned table. This contains the hashes of the most common passwords.
If found, the function call returns "denied" and lets the user know that passphrase is too insecure.
If not found, the function call returns "unknown" and lets the user know that their passphrase was not found.
They are then prompted to enter their name to sign up. The branching-chat_login function is called again, this time with the hash AND name.




User types in passphrase and hits Enter.
The passphrase is hashed and a call to branching-chat_login is made.
The Lambda function looks up the hash in the branching.chat_users table. If found, it returns the user's name.
If not, it returns false and the user will be prompted to enter their name and submit again. This will be added to the users table.
With a valid/registered passphrase, the list of chats that id participated in will be retrieved.


"denied" "unknown" "found:Name"
